On the other side of a view-obstructing wall there's a table with corners oriented to the cardinal directions (North, South, East, and West).  On each corner of the table is a playing card, and the cards begin randomly as face up or down.  You can instruct an operator to flip over (such that a card being face up will become face down, and vice versa) any number of cards by specifying one or more cardinal directions.  Each time the operator flips one or more cards for you, the table is rotated such that a corner is randomly selected to be north. If at any time all cards on the table are face up, you win.  Find a finite series of instructions which guarantees you will win.
